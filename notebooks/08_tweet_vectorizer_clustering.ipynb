    "- Words in our dataset like `mairene`, `irene`, `nhirene`, `nhsandy`, `risandy`, etc. are highly associated with tweets made during power outages and are usually about outages. While these specific words would not be useful in detecting outages following a future event, they suggest that the name of a given storm (and the name combined with state abbreviations) could be useful in detecting outages following an event.\n",
    "- Tweets containing `etrs` (standing for Estimated Time of Restorations) could be useful, but most of these are made by power companies providing updates after they already know about outages.\n",
    "- `ojatg` and `fccenw` are from National Grid's short link to their Outage Central interactive outage map with ETRs. These links are no longer used, apparently because they have shifted to state-specific maps. `Outage Central` and `outage map` could be useful, however are similar to `etrs` and may not provide info about outage locations that power companies don't already know about.\n",
    "- Taking a closer look at the tweets in our dataset `earthday` and `presidents` suggests these won't be helpful words to use as indicators of power outages."
